description: This resource contains lecture slides on short discourse on the calculus
  of variations, extremization of path entegrals, the Euler-Lagrange equations and
  constants of the motion, Brachistochrone problem, extremal aging for inertially
  moving clocks, and optional problems in the use of the calculus of variations as
  applied to Lagragian mechanics and other problems in the extremization of path integrals.
