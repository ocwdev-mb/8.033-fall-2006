description: This resource contains lecture slides on strong and weak principles of
  equivalence, local equivalence of gravity and acceleration, elevator thought experiments,
  gravitational redshift, light bending, relative acceleration of test particles in
  falling elevator of finite size, definition of the metric tensor, and analogy between
  the metric tensor and the ordinary potential, and between Einstein's field equations
  and Poisson's equation.
